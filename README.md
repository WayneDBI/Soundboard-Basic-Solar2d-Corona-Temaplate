A soundboard based Solar2D / Corona SDK Template.

This template will show you how to build a complete soundboard based application with multiple themes, and multiple swipe screens (Horizontal & Vertical) for your users to select a sound.

The code is easily editable, just replace the sounds and graphics. Maybe add a few more themes or add lots of sounds? This template has been built for the iPhone landscape, but we have tested it on Android Nexus phone and everything runs silky smooth.

Another simple thing you can do with this template is convert it into a MENU / LEVEL select system. Each button stores it’s ID/Level into a global variable, so you can load a specific scene or level based on the captured data.
